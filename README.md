# TASK-LIST-APP

#This is a practice project
it is a sample CRUD JS application. when done with the app, the user should be able to add tasks, update added tasks, delete tasks, filter through the tasks.
#I am also trying to add a functionality to make sure that tasks are not added twice.

#it also uses the webstorage API so that when the app is reloaded the tasks are still availabe in localstorage.
